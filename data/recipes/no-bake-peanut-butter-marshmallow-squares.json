    "In a large pot over medium-low heat, combine the butterscotch chips, peanut butter and butter. Stir frequently until the mixture is completely melted.",
    "Let cool, and fold in marshmallows and vanilla extract quickly. I like to throw my marshmallows in the freezer for 10 minutes before this step to prevent them from melting all together.",
    "Pour the mixture into a lined 8×8 or 9×9 inch square pan and spread evenly. Refrigerate for 1 hour minimum to set, then cut into bars. Store in refrigerator or freezer (I actually prefer my peanut butter squares straight from the freezer).",
    "Put bag of marshmallows in the freezer and line an 8×8 pan with parchment paper.",
    "Melt butterscotch chips, peanut butter, and butter in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat, and let cool to ensure the marshmallows don't melt in next step.",
    "Quickly fold in vanilla and marshmallows.",
    "Spread mixture into 8×8 or 9x9 inch pan and gently spread with a spatula or spoon.",
    "Refrigerate until firm. Approximately 1 hour.",
    "Remove from pan and slice into squares. Store squares in refrigerator or freezer."
