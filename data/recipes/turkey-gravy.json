  "instructions": [
    "Begin by melting the butter in a medium saucepan.",
    "Add the onions.",
    "Cook until very soft, about 15 minutes.",
    "Whisk in the flour and cook for a few minutes to get rid of the raw flour taste.",
    "Then whisk in your turkey drippings/chicken broth and Cognac.",
    "Cook for about 5 minutes until thickened, then stir in the cream and fresh herbs.",
    "Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remember, the gravy should be generously seasoned because turkey is very bland. And always taste the gravy with a piece of meat to be sure the seasoning is right.",
    "Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until very soft and translucent, about 15 minutes.",
    "Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Whisk in the turkey drippings/chicken broth and Cognac and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and fresh herbs and season to taste with salt and pepper. (Gravy should be generously seasoned because turkey is pretty bland; I usually add at least ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper, but it depends on how salty your broth and drippings are.) Transfer the gravy to a gravy boat and serve.",
    "Make-Ahead Instructions: The gravy can be made, without the turkey drippings, up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated. Use 2 cups of chicken broth and add about ½ cup defatted turkey drippings after cooking the turkey when you reheat the gravy. Note that the gravy will thicken up in the fridge; thin it to the desired consistency with water or chicken broth upon reheating."
