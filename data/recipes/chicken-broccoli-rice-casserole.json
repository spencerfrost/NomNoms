    "Cream of Chicken Soup Substitutes",
    "This recipe can be made with Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Broccoli, Cheddar Cheese, and Broccoli Cheese.",
    "OR, skip the can and make my 15-minute Cream of Chicken Soup recipe!",
    "Refrigerator",
    "This casserole can be assembled ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 2 days prior to baking. Let it sit out for 30 minutes prior to baking or add 15 minutes to baking time.",
    "The cracker/butter topping should be added at the end of baking.",
    "Freezer:",
    "Assemble the casserole as outlined and do not bake. Let it thaw for 24 hours in the fridge. Let it sit out for 30 minutes prior to baking and add 10 minutes to baking time.",
    "The cracker/butter topping should be added at the end of baking.",
    "Storage",
    "Store in the fridge for up to 3 days.",
    "This casserole is a great meal to freeze and is best if used within 3 months of freezing.",
    "I often reheat frozen lunch-sized portions in the microwave from a frozen state. If possible, I’ll also bake it 350 degree oven at the end to crisp up the top.",
    "Note: This recipe is designed to allow you to prepare all of the casserole ingredients in one pot before transferring to a casserole dish for baking. Before you begin, refer to your rice package for the amount of liquid (we'll use chicken broth) and cooking time. I use white long grain rice and the cooking time/liquid amount below works perfectly.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350° F.",
    "Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with Italian seasoning and desired amount of salt and pepper.",
    "Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat until melted. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. Note: This step is not needed if using a cooked rotisserie chicken.",
    "Add the chicken broth, olive oil, and rice to the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.",
    "Cover tightly and cook for 6 minutes.",
    "Add the broccoli and replace the cover. Cook for 9 more minutes, or until no liquid remains in the pot and the rice is cooked through. (If it's not cooked through yet, quickly replace lid and simmer 5 more minutes, or until cooked through.)",
    "Turn off the heat and leave the cover on. Let the rice stand for 10 minutes, do not stir. Any rice on the bottom of the pot will release.",
    "Add the cooked chicken, cream of chicken soup, milk, sour cream, optional seasonings, and half of the cheddar cheese.",
    "Add to a lightly greased 9 x 13 casserole dish and top with remaining cheese.",
    "Cover and bake for 15 minutes.",
    "Add the Topping:",
    "Melt the butter and crumble up the crackers. Combine to form the topping for the casserole.",
    "Top the casserole with the crumbled cracker topping and bake uncovered for 10 additional minutes.",
    "Let the casserole sit for 5 minutes prior to serving.",
    "Freezer:",
    "Assemble the casserole as outlined and do not bake. Let it thaw for 24 hours in the fridge. Let it sit out for 30 minutes prior to baking or add 15 minutes to baking time.",
    "The cracker/butter topping should be added at the end of baking.",
