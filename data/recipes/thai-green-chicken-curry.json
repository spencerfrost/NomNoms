  "instructions": [
    "Heat 1 tbsp of coconut oil in a wok or deep skillet. Add chicken thighs to the pan and cook for a few minutes until almost cooked all the way. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the pan and set aside.",
    "In the same pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil and add the green chilies, shallot, bell peppers, carrots, green onions. Cook for about 30 seconds, then add the ginger and garlic. Cook for another minute until everything gets fragrant. Vegetables should still be crunchy.",
    "Add the Thai Green Curry paste and cook for a minute until everything comes together.",
    "Add the coconut milk to the pan and mix thoroughly. Let the curry cook for a few minutes until bubbling hot. Squeeze in some fresh lime.",
    "Add in the broccolini and the snap peas along with the chicken that you par cooked earlier. Let everything poach in the hot curry until the chicken is finished cooking fully - approximately another 3 to 4 minutes. Take care not to overcook the vegetables. Stir in the basil leaves a few seconds before serving.",
    "Serve hot over jasmine rice. Top with all the garnishes - red Thai peppers, green onions, cucumbers, more basil and a squeeze of lime."
