  "instructions": [
    "Add the chopped ginger and water to a small saucepan along with any of the optional add-ins.",
    "Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, cover, reduce heat to medium, and allow to boil for 7-12 minutes (7 minutes for a more mild ginger flavor or 12 minutes for a stronger brew — keeping in mind the flavor will continue to develop off the heat). Strain through a fine mesh strainer into mugs. Optionally, sweeten to taste with your favorite sweetener (we prefer honey) and/or serve with sliced lemon or orange.",
    "Leftover tea can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or cooled and transferred to an ice cube tray for adding to cocktails, lemonade, iced tea, or water. Note: The ginger flavor will intensify as the tea sits. The ginger and spices can be reused again with fresh water, but the second batch of tea will not be as strong."
