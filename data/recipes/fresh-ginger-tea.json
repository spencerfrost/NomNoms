    "Combine the sliced ginger and water in a saucepan over high heat. If you’re adding a cinnamon stick, fresh turmeric, or fresh mint, add it now. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer for 5 minutes (for extra-strong ginger flavor, simmer for up to 10 minutes).",
    "Remove the pot from the heat. Carefully pour the mixture through a mesh sieve into a heat-safe liquid measuring cup, or directly into a mug.",
    "If desired, serve with a lemon round and/or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, to taste. Serve hot."
