    "✎ RECIPE NOTES",
    "Fish sauce brands: Different brands of fish sauce vary by saltiness and intensity. You may need to adjust the amounts slightly to according to your taste. If you find it too salty, add more water and sugar. For a tangier sauce add more lime juice or vinegar.",
    "For a vegan/vegetarian option: replace the fish sauce with light soy sauce. Dark soy sauce overwhelms the sauce and makes it too dark.",
    "You can skip the vinegar and replace the amount with lime juice but I prefer adding a bit of vinegar because it gives the sauce a bright flavor that the lime juice lacks. The lime juice adds a nice citrus flavor but isn't as tangy as vinegar.",
    "Storing leftovers: Place leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to one week.",
    "Make ahead: If you plan on making this ahead, leave out the shredded carrots and store the sauce in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Add the shredded carrots right before serving.",
    "Serve with these fresh vegetarian summer rolls.",
