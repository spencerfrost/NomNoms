    "Toss the chicken with the garlic salt, paprika, onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper until evenly coated.",
    "Place a rack in the bottom of a 6- or 8-quart Instant PotÂ® and add 1 cup of water. Put the chicken on the rack. Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 7 minutes (see Cook's Note). After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and shred with two forks, reserving liquid in the pot. Remove the rack.",

    "The chicken will keep up to 4 days. Let cool completely before refrigerating.",
    "BBQ Chicken Sandwiches: Toss the cooked chicken with your favorite BBQ sauce and serve as sandwiches topped with store-bought coleslaw.",
