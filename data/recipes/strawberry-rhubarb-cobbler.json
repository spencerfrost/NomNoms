  "instructions": [
    "Mix the fruit",
    "Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and flour. Add the rhubarb and strawberries, and toss to coat. Transfer the mixture to a greased 11×7-inch baking dish. Spread it out evenly, and dot it with the butter.",
    "Mix the dough",
    "In a clean large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt for the dough. In another bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the oil and water. Add the oil mixture to the flour mixture, stirring with a fork until a sticky dough forms.",
    "Roll out the pastry",
    "Sandwich the dough between two pieces of waxed paper. Using a rolling pin or your hands, press it into an 11×7-inch rectangle. Remove the top piece of waxed paper, then invert the dough over the filling in the baking dish. Gently peel off the top waxed paper. Brush the pastry with milk, and sprinkle with sugar.",
    "Bake the cobbler",
    "Bake the cobbler for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden brown. If desired, serve with ice cream.",
    "Editor’s Tip: The crust on this cobbler forms a solid surface, so some filling might seep out along its edges as is bakes. You can slice a couple of steam vents into the pastry before baking it to reduce seepage. You can also set a baking sheet on the rack under the baking dish in the oven in case it bubbles over. Let the baked cobbler cool on a wire rack until it stops bubbling, about 10 minutes. The filling will continue to set as it cools.",
    "How to Store Strawberry-Rhubarb Cobbler",
    "If you won’t be eating it warm from the oven, you need to refrigerate cobbler as soon as it has cooled completely. Cover the baking dish with a lid or foil, and refrigerate the leftovers for four or five days. You can also cover the cobbler tightly, and freeze it for up to three months. To reheat the refrigerated cobbler, just slide the pan into a 350° oven for about 15 minutes. Frozen cobbler should be thawed in the fridge overnight before reheating.",
    "Can you make strawberry-rhubarb cobbler ahead of time?",
    "Freshly baked cobbler has the flakiest, lightest crust. The topping becomes denser and softer the longer it waits in the fridge—and perhaps even soggy as it soaks up the filling. If you need to make strawberry-rhubarb cobbler ahead of time, try this trick: Bake the filling in its baking dish, but make the topping on a separate, parchment-lined baking sheet.",
    "Once both have cooled completely, cover and refrigerate the filling in the baking dish, but leave the top crust on the counter in an airtight container. When it’s time to serve the cobbler, set the crust top on the filling, and reheat the dessert in the oven at 350° for about 15 minutes.",
    "Preheat oven to 425°. In a large bowl, mix sugar and flour. Add fruit; toss to coat. Transfer to a greased 11x7-in. baking dish. Dot with butter.",
    "For crust, in a bowl, mix flour and salt. In another bowl, whisk oil and water; add to flour mixture, stirring with a fork until a dough is formed (dough will be sticky).",
    "Roll dough between two pieces of waxed paper into an 11x7-in. rectangle. Remove top piece of waxed paper; invert rectangle over filling. Gently peel off waxed paper. Brush pastry with milk; sprinkle with sugar.",
    "Bake 40-50 minutes or until golden brown. If desired, serve with ice cream."
