    "Add celery and onion, cook another 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add leeks and garlic, and cook an additional 2-3 minutes, until fragrant and tender.",
    "Season with a 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Stir to coat all vegetables with salt and pepper, then transfer entire contents of pan to slow cooker.",
    "Wipe any excess liquid from underneath and from the sides of of the saute pan, then return the same pan back to the stovetop, still on medium heat.",
    "Pour in chicken broth, and allow it to heat through to a simmer - about 3-4 minutes.",
    "Add 1/4 tsp. salt to chicken broth and potatoes, then allow to simmer for another 3-4 minutes.",
    "Transfer entire contents of the pan to the slow cooker, directly on top of the vegetables.",
    "Cook on high for four hours. After this time is up, remove the lid. Using a potato masher, proceed to mash the potatoes down to as small of bits as possible. Try to achieve a soup consistency.",
    "Pour in half and half one quarter cup at a time, still mashing as you pour it in. Once all half and half is in, stir to fully combine all ingredients. Add additional salt and pepper to taste, if necessary.",
    "Serve hot! Top with chopped chives. (I also added a touch of shredded cheese... :) )"
