- `components/profile/profile-form.tsx` - Profile editing form
- `components/profile/user-recipes-list.tsx` - User's recipes management
- `app/api/profile/route.ts` - Profile update API endpoint
- `__tests__/components/profile/` - Comprehensive test suite

### Modified Files

- `components/common/hamburger-menu.tsx` - Added Profile menu item

## 🧪 Testing

✅ **Unit Tests**: Complete test coverage for profile components

- Profile form validation and submission
- Recipe list rendering and management
- Error handling and user feedback
- Navigation and interactions

✅ **Manual Testing**:

- Profile page accessible at `/profile`
- Form validation works correctly
- Recipe management functionality
- Responsive design

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: Profile page redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in
- **Password Security**: Current password required for password changes
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all profile updates
- **CSRF Protection**: Using NextAuth.js built-in protections
- **Authorization**: Users can only modify their own data

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Grid layout that adapts to screen size
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: For destructive actions like recipe deletion
- **Consistent Design**: Matches existing app styling with shadcn/ui components

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

The implementation is ready for the roadmap features:

- Recipe collections (user recipes are already organized)
- Recipe favorites (can extend the recipes list)
- Profile avatars (user model supports it)
- Recipe sharing (visibility controls already implemented)

## ✨ Technical Highlights
